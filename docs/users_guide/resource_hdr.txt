Resource Definition Reference
===============================
Overview
-------------
This section documents all of the resource definitions for the current release
of Engage. We divide the resources into three groups:
*Primary Resources*, which are not referenced as dependencies by any
other resources, *Host Resources*, which have no dependencies, and
*Interior Resources*, which have dependencies and are referenced by
other resources. Within each section, resources are listed in
alphabetical order.

Each resource's section title corresponds to its *key* -- the name and
version name used to uniquely identify the resource type.
Within each resource entry, we find a descriptive name,
additional documentation (if present in the resource), a list of
configuration properties, and a list of
the resource's potential dependencies.
