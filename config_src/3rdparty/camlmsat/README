README file for camlmsat
========================

History
-------
2009-02-05 jfischer Created this readme file, added optimized build
2007-??-?? jfischer Created camlmsat


Description
-----------
Camlmsat is an Ocaml interface to the minisat SAT solver
(http://minisat.se/MiniSat.html). It provides two APIs:
 - camlmsat.mli is a direct interface to the minisat C++ APIs. It
   requires that predicates be specified in Conjunctive Normal Form.
 - predicates.mli is a higher-level interface that defines a predicate
   type in OCaml. This arbitrary predicates are then converted to CNF
   before being passed to the camlmsat API.

This version of the code has been tested against minisat2-070721.


Linking
-------
To link this library with your byte-code OCaml program, add the
following to the command line:
   -custom  -cc g++ libcamlmsat.a predicates.cmo

To link this library with your native-code OCaml program, add the
following to the command line:
   -cc g++ libcamlmsat.a predicates.cmx

You will also need to include this directory in the OCaml search path
(e.g. via -I on the command line).


Tests
-----
The makefile builds and runs some unit tests:
 - test_stubs: test the low level camlmsat API
 - test_preds: test the predicates API.
 - test_toplevel: an OCaml toplevel with the predicate library linked in.


ToDo
----
It would be nice for the predicates API to provide a "one_of"
exclusive-or construct. This could use memoization to translate to
more efficent CNF than an naive implementation.
